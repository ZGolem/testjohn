			At Elton John's Thanksgiving day concert, John joined the stage as a guest performer. The idea originated from a bet where John would perform if 'Whatever Gets You Thru The Night' hit number one on the charts, rehearsals took place on November 26th. John was so nervous to return to the stage that he was "physically sick". John's appearance was supposed to be a surprise, but it was a poorly kept secret, and some news outlets even reported it prior. John and Elton performed a three song set (besides the Beatles, none of the songs had ever been performed live by John), and John later rejoined stage during the encore to play tambourine on Elton's 'The Bitch is Back'. With that, John's last ever stadium performance was completed. The performance was released on EP and 45 (these mixes later appearing on the LENNON 1990 CD boset), as well as Elton's 1975 LP 'Here and There' with a different mix.
