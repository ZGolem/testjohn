			The Toronto Rock and Roll Revival was a 12 hour concert featuring notable Rock and Roll artists, especially those from the 50s such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, B.B. King, Little Richard, and Gene Vincent. Other notable performers included Whiskey Hotel, Cat Mother, Blind Faith, Chicago, and The Doors.
</br></br>
John was invited by John Brower just the day prior to the concert, he surprised Brower by asking to perform. "They were inviting us as king and queen to preside over it, not play – but I didn’t hear that bit. I said, ‘Just give me time to get a band together.'" The appearance of John wasn't known to the audience beforehand.
</br></br>
John invited George Harrison to join him, to which he ultimately turned down. The band consisted of Lennon, Yoko Ono, Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann and Alan White, becoming the first live lineup of the Plastic Ono Band as well as the first LP credited to the band. The group left for the flight to Toronto on September 13th, rehearsing their set on the plane. Due to the sound of the engines and the electric guitars, the group found it very hard to hear their instruments. The group arrived to the stadium, with John promptly throwing up (a combination of serious nerves and serious drug use), arriving backstage they had a second rehearsal. The setlist of the show consisted mostly of oldies and the recent Beatles/Solo releases. The show closed with an electric version of the 'Wedding Album' song 'John John (Let's Hope For Peace)' backed by the feedback of their electric guitars.</br></br>
Live Peace in Toronto 1969 was released on LP that year in December, and was later remixed for release in 1995. The original mix is only available on Vinyl and Reel to Reel and has yet to be released digitally. The documentaries 'Sweet Revival' and 'Toronto69' both showed footage from the concert.
