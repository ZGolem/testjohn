			<center><p>It has always been my dream to collect and document content from all of the Bealtes. Earlier last year I released a project collecting all the content from the "Some Time In New York City' era, under the banner of the 'All Together Now' project. This project aims to collect and archive every recording/mix of the Beatles. This project was inspired but a similar cancelled community project called 'Come Together' from the (now defunct) Bootlegzone.com (you can see the mascot of this above). I hope I have helped provide some insight into John's career, and that you find this website useful in some way. <p> Credit to the great <a href="https://www.the-paulmccartney-project.com/">Paul McCartney Project</a> for the idea and permission to make this site. This site provides invaluable session info for both Paul and the Beatles!</p> 
			<h1>Thank You!</h1>
			 <p> Thanks to everyone who helped with this project! Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adambound7284">AdamBound</a> for help proofreading and collecting info and to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thebeatlesvideos01">The Beatles Videos</a> for his Day by Day series. Thanks to Reign for helping with 'All Together Now' artwork (shown above). Thank you to everyone on my Discord server for support and for being such an amazing community, and lastly thanks to <b>you</b> reading and exploring the content on this website!  
 </p> <p> Without the use of many great resources this website wouldn't be possible, I would like to thank Chip Madinger's <a href="https://lennonology.com/order/">Lennonology & Eight Arms to Hold Me</a> for providing (probably) the most comprehensive John document ever written, this project wouldn't be possible without it. Thanks also goes out to the great forums <a href="https://www.beatlesbible.com/">Beatles Bible</a> and <a href="https://forum.beatlegdb.com/BeatlegDB"> BeatlegDB</a> </p>
