			<center><p>It has always been my dream to collect and document content from all of the Bealtes. Earlier last year I released a project collecting all the content from the 'Some Time In New York City' era, under the banner of the 'All Together Now' project. This project aims to collect and archive every recording/mix of the Beatles. This project was inspired but a similar cancelled community project called 'Come Together' from the (now defunct) Bootlegzone.com (you can see the mascot of this above). I hope I have helped provide some insight into John's career, and that you find this website useful in some way. 
			<h1>Thank You!</h1>
