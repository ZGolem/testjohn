			Prior to dating John, Yoko had agreed to join a performance showcasing "natural music and free jazz", lead by the Danish avant-garde saxophonist John Tchicai at Cambridge University. John later agreed to join, saying "You should do it, and tell them that you're coming with a band.'' 
</br> </br>
Twenty minutes into the 3-hour performance, Yoko took the microphone from vocalist Maggie Nichols and announced, "This is a piece called Cambridge 1969." Fifteen minutes after John and Yoko took control, Tchicai and John Stevens returned and joined in. Roger Williams of Varsity later noted that "All of what was heard was not of value, and there was a fair amount of rubbish about, but here was a genuinely creative atmosphere in which anything at all could have happened." The piece was released as the A-side to 'Unfinished Music 2: Life with the Lions'.
