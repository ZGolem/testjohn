			During a week in mid-February (air date), John and Yoko co-hosted 5 episodes of the Mike Douglas show. Mike Douglas opened each show with a song, this time being 'I Whistle A Happy Tune' from the King and I. John and Yoko performed 'Sisters, O Sisters' before introducing their special guest, Chuck Berry. John and Chuck Berry played through two of his oldies, and the performance contained the now imfamous muting of Yoko's microphone. Mike Douglas sang the Sondheim song 'Losing My Mind' and the show closed with an avant-grade piece sometimes titled "Mental Melodies". The piece consisted of John and Yoko's alpha brainwaves along with keyboard from research psychologist David Rosenboom. The third episode (fouth episode recorded) was broadcast on Feburary 16th, despite not appearing on any CD release, the entire week worth of episodes was released on VHS in 1998.
