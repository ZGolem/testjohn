			On this day the Plastic Ono Band took part in the benefit concert 'Peace For Christmas' for the children's charity UNICEF. The concert took place at the Lyceum Ballroom in London and also featured a poster from John and Yoko's 'WAR IS OVER' campaign (later evolving into their Christmas single 'Happy Xmas (War is Over)'.)
</br></br>
The planned lineup included Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, and Alan White from the previous Toronto concert, now along with Billy Preston. However, the night of the performance, Clapton arrived with most of Delaney & Bonnieâ€™s touring band, adding Delaney Bramlett, Bonnie Bramlett, Jim Gorden, Bobby Keys, Jim Price, and (perhaps most notably) George Harrison. Keith Moon even joined in, playing Alan White's tom toms. John would later refer to this pairing as "Plastic Ono Super Group". Other acts included the Young Rascals, Desmond Dekker and the Aces, Blue Mink and Black Velvet, with Emperor Rosko being the disc jockey between performances. 
</br></br>
The performance was recorded on four-track tape by Geoff Emerick, with Peter Bown and John Kurlander engineering. Overdubbing was also done to the tracks in October of 1971, with John overdubbing an additional vocal and Klaus Voormann overdubbing an additional bassline. Nicky Hopkins (who didn't appear in the original concert) overdubbed electric piano after Preston's track was lost. The tracks were released in 1972 on the 'Some Time In New York City' jam disc, with the nearly 40 minute 'Don't Worry Kyoko' edited down to 15 minutes.
