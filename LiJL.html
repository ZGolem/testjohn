			On Labor Day of 1972, John and Yoko performed on the annual Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon. The show was his last truely live TV performance, and was backed by Elephant's Memory, also for the last time. Yoko performed her recently written song 'Now or Never', predating the studio performance. The show closed with a rendition of 'Give Peace a Chance' reminiscent of the recent performance at the <a href="OnetoOne8pm.html" class="nav-arrow-right">One to One concert</a>. With that moment, the Lennon's busy year of live performances drew to a close. The introduction to the show as well as part of 'Give Peace a Chance' was released on Anthology in 1998. Footage from the show has never been officially released since broadcast.
