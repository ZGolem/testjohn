			During a week in mid-February (air date), John and Yoko co-hosted 5 episodes of the Mike Douglas show. Mike Douglas opened each show with a song, this time being the Beatles song 'Michelle'. The night also included a performance by the Chambers Brothers before finally ending with John and Yoko playing 'It's So Hard'. This would be the first time Elphant's Memory played backing for John, a trend that would continue throughout the week of episodes and onto the One to One concerts. The first episode was broadcast on Feburary 14th, despite not appearing on any CD release, the entire week worth of episodes was released on VHS in 1998.
