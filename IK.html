			Marking the first time a Beatle appeared on the BBC TV show since 1966, John and Yoko performed "live" on Top of the Pops to promote their new song. A backing track with one of John's double-tracked vocals removed was prepared, and the instruments for the show were mimed. Rehearsals took place prior to the performance, where John also performed a demo of 'Mind Games' titled "Make Love, Not War", captured by Tony Cox's camera. During recording of the show, John performed four takes of the song, with only the latter two being released. The first version of 'Instant Karma!', containing the duo in turtlenecks and Yoko crocheting, was broadcast on BBC on February 12th and released on the 2003 DVD 'Lennon Legend'. The second version, with Yoko holding cue cards was broadcast on February 19th and was released on the 1992 'The John Lennon Video Collection' VHS.
