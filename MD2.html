			During a week in mid-February (air date), John and Yoko co-hosted 5 episodes of the Mike Douglas show. Mike Douglas opened each show with a song, this time being the Beatles song 'With A Little Help From My Friends'. The night also included a performance by Yellow Pearl, before finally ending with Yoko singing 'Midsummer New York' from her album 'Fly'. The second episode was broadcast on Feburary 15th, despite not appearing on any CD release, the entire week worth of episodes was released on VHS in 1998.
