			Rock and Roll Circus was a Concert Film hosted by the Rolling Stones, starring John & Yoko, Jethro Tull, The Who, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, and the Rolling Stones. Rehearsals and camera tests ran from December 6th to the 9th, where John performed a rendition of 'Revolution.' 
</br></br>
John, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Mitch Mitchell joined as a supergroup known by 'The Dirty Mac' and played a version of 'Yer Blues'. Yoko emerged from a black bag on the stage, where she and violinist Ivry Gitlis performed an improvised 12-bar blues titled 'Whole Lotta Yoko' / 'Her Blues'. John then introduced the Rolling Stones (and coined a running joke that would be prevalent during the Beatles Get Back sessions.) The footage was captured on video and film, with sound recorded by Glyn Johns and Jimmy Miller on Olympicâ€™s mobile studio.
</br></br>
The Rolling Stones later felt their performance was substandard, and decided not to release Rock And Roll Circus as the planned BBC special. The album was officially released in 1995. A VHS and laserdisc was released in 1996, with a DVD version in 2004. A deluxe edition with a blu-ray and including the 'Revolution' rehearsal was released in 2019.
