			On the last of his series of TV performances, John would once again create quite an infamous moment during his second appearance on the Dick Cavett Show. After adressing concerns from the audience about the single, John and Yoko performed the live debut of 'Woman is the Nigger of the World'. Being the first live performance after the March 'Some Time In New York City' sessions, they also debuted 'We're All Water', which would later return at the One to One concert later that year. The show would be broadcast on May 11th, despite the lack of CD release the show has seen some limited DVD release.
